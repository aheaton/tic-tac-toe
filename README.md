<h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>This is the classic game of Tic Tac Toe created during my time at General Assembly Boston. This is the first application I have built that interacts with a pre-made backend (Rails).</p>

<h3>Planning & Stategy:</h3>
<p>Pre-planning for this project was essential in my success. I started out by thinking through game logic and how I would store each move locally and continuously check for a win, loss, or tie. Once I had an idea about game logic, I read through the Rails API documentation to ensure my plan for the game logic would work as I would have to send all data to the server for processing and storage. Lastly, I had to think through authentication based on the API I was given to ensure I could map game data to a particular user.</p>

<p>Once planning was complete, I approached development in separate pieces - basic HTML for the board, game logic, authentication, saving game state, and finally styling. As I encountered problems, I would draw diagrams, write out steps, and ask myself questions about what I was looking to achieve. Also, discussing my thought process with other developers helped immensely.</p>

<h3>Future Fixes:</h3>
<p>Make the application mobile-optimized. My focus for this first project was to make the game clean and defect-free, but I would like to design future applications with a mobile-first mindset.</p>
